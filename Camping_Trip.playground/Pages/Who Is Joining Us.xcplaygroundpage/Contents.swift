 # Camping Trip
 
 In this project, you will use Swift to narrate taking your friends and family on a camping trip! We will use everything you’ve learned so far to accomplish this. We will use `Variables` and `Constants` to create our objects, `Mathematical operators` to keep track of our spending, `conditionals`, `functions`, and `loops` to bring our trip to life! Let’s start by defining who is joining us on this trip.

 ### Who is joining us?

 Experiences are best shared with others! Tell us about who you want to join you on this trip. We recommend at least two camping buddies.

 1.  Create a `variable` or a `constant` for your first name
     1. Choose the correct mutability
 2. Create a `variable` or a `constant` for your last name
     1. Choose the correct mutability
 3. Create a `variable` or a `constant` for your age
     1. Choose the correct mutability
 4. Create a `variable` or a `constant` for your birthday
     1. Choose the correct mutability
 5. Repeat for all the guests you want to bring
     1. Minimum of two guests
