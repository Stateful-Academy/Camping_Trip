 ### The Trip

 Now the fun begins! We have some shopping to do before we depart on the `Memory Maker 2022` camping trip. The first thing we need to do is to recreate your `budget` on this page.

 1. Create your `budget` and assign a default value your `budget` ended with on the previous page.
 2. The first item to buy is a tent. The best one you can find costs `865.72`. Decrease the `budget` by that amount
 3. Each member of camp-squad 2022 needs to buy a backpack. Each backpack will cost the group `60`.
     1. Declare a `function` named `buyBackpacks` that takes in two parameters - `groupCount` and `cost`
 4. Within the body of the `function` handle the math accordingly and update the `budget`
     1. Print the new `budget` you have.
 5. Now we need to snag some firewood. Declare a new `function` with one parameter named `quantity` to handle this.
 6. The store is having a sale on firewood! Firewood is `5` for `10`! What a killer deal. Create a constant named `bundle` and set it to the `quantity` divided by `10`
     1. Now find the cost of the wood by multiplying the `bundle` by 5
     2. Update and print the `budget`

 The last items to buy are some water bottles. Everyone needs a good `Hydroflask` which costs `35`, but we may be running out of money. The basic water bottle is only `10` so that’s a great backup.

 1. Let’s write a `function` that takes in how many people are in our group.
 2. In the `function`'s body, we need to multiply the number of people in our group by how much a `Hydroflask` is.
     1. If our `budget` is greater than or equal to that amount, write a `print` statement that says - Yay! We are buying the fancy ones! It will cost us $. Be sure to use string interpolation to display the total cost.
     2. If the Hydro flasks are too expensive, we will print - Bummer! We are buying the basic ones. It will cost us $.
 3. We need to update our `budget` either way. Be sure to add that to your function. Try not to repeat this code.

 Nice work! I think we are just about ready to go! Just a few last-minute arrangements to make…
