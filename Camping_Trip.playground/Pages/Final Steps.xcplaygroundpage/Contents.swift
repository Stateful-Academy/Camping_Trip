 ### Final Steps

 The `Memory Maker 2022` camping trip is just about to make way! All we have left to do is choose our destination, verify we have the items we need, and then get going!

 1. To choose our destination, we need to define the possibilities. Create four `constants` with the values
     1.  “Warm and sunny. Good fishing”
     2.  “Rainy, but with lots of trees.”
     3.  “High chance of snow, but amazing views”
     4.  “High temperatures with no shade. The rock-climbing is top tier.”
 2.  Choose one of the four constants you just created as your preferred personal `destination`
 3. As the group discusses where to go, you’ll want to share your opinion on the matter. Create an `if - else` statement that checks if `destination` matches each of the four options.
     1. Create a unique print statement for each case.
 4. Now that you’ve written that long `if - else` statement, you notice it’s a bit large… Create a `switch` statement to handle the same logic.
     1. You can use the documentation via this [link](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html) to learn more about `switch` statements.
     2. Each `switch` needs a `defualt` case. The `default` would be just to stay home.
 5. We finally know where we are going! Let’s do a final check on our equipment. Create a `backpack` array and assign a default value of four Strings. `“Tent”,“Jacket”, “Toothbrush”,”socks”`
 6. Let’s look at each item in the backpack to ensure we have it all. Write a `for-each` statement that prints each item in your backpack.
     1. You can use the documentation via this [link](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html) to learn more about `for-each` statement
     - Hint: For-Each
         
         ```swift
         let numberWords = ["one", "two", "three"]
         for word in numberWords {
             print(word)
         }
         // Prints "one"
         // Prints "two"
         // Prints "three"
         
         numberWords.forEach { word in
             print(word)
         }
         // Same as above
         ```
         
 7.  Let’s repack that bag and get on our way! The camp spot is only `20` miles away now! Create a `variable` named `distanceToCamp` and set it to `20`
 8. Everyone is a bit tired from all the shopping and math, so some of your friends have decided to ask you if we are there yet every `5` miles. Write a while loop that will print `“Are we there yet?”` If the `distanceToCamp` is greater than `0`.
     1. Be sure to remove `5` each iteration.
 9. WE MADE IT! WE ARE FINALLY AT BASE CAMP! We need to get the tent out of the `backpack`. Declare a function named `lookForItem` with a `parameter` of an `item: String`
 10. Write a `for loop` that checks if the `currentItem` is equal to the `item` you are looking for.
     1. If you found it print “Nice! I found the item” and `break` out of this `for loop`.
         1. Be sure to use `string interpolation`.
     2. Otherwise, print “Keep looking… I swear it’s in there.”
 11. Be sure to `call` this function and look for the tent.

 Nice work! You’ve worked hard for this trip! Enjoy some good times with your friends!
